## CommonProvider

CommonProvider is a simple library built to give you a consistent and easy way to access your providers (multiple implementations of a common interface AKA Strategy pattern). Its sometimes called the Provider pattern but I think thats just a glorified Strategy pattern. Out of the box it supports loading providers and settings defined in a configuration file and also loading providers from a predefined directory. You can also write your own custom Provider Loader
